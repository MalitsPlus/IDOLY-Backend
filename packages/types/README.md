# @outloudvi/hoshimi-types

This packages includes the types used by the Web App, [info-pride](https://github.com/outloudvi/info-pride), as well as the backend, [IDOLY-backend](https://github.com/MalitsPlus/IDOLY-Backend).

All files beginning with `Proto` are generally generated by [`@hoshimi/parser`](https://github.com/MalitsPlus/IDOLY-Backend/tree/master/packages/parser) with the C# definition files of the protobuf structs.

The package is published on GitHub Package Registry through the placeholder repository [outloudvi/hoshimi-packages](https://github.com/outloudvi/hoshimi-packages), and thus prefixed with `@outloudvi/`.
